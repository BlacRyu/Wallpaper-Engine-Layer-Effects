# Wallpaper-Engine-Layer-Effects
Custom scene layer effects I've created for use in Wallpaper Engine.

# Installation
Place the desired effect folder(s) into Wallpaper Engine's effects directory. The default location is 

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\assets\effects`

The effects should then be available in the editor.
